HOMEGUARD SECURITY
Project Vision For both inexperienced and tech-savvy users who have a wide range of home devices, it can be hard to manage them all and make sure that they are protected from any security threats or potential vulnerabilities. The HomeGuard Security is a multi-platform security system that allows people to view all the devices in one place and monitor any possible security risks in real-time. This will provide users with a brief description of an existing threat to any given device and suggest a solution to help neutralise the problem. Where the HomeGuard Security differs from existing products is that it will offer a simple and easy product that can support manual scanning, automated scanning, and a comprehensive record of all the scan history of a given device.
